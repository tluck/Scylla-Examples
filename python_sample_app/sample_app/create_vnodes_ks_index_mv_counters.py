Demo: create a keyspace with tablets disabled (vnodes-based) holding

  * a sample table            -> sensor_readings
  * a secondary index on it   -> sensor_readings_region_idx (on region)
  * a materialized view on it -> sensor_readings_by_region
  * optionally (-c), a second counter table -> device_event_counts

Tablets must be disabled for this shape on older releases: counter tables,
secondary indexes and materialized views all gained tablets support only in
later ScyllaDB versions, so a vnodes keyspace is the portable baseline. This
is the same kind of source keyspace used by
copy_counter_table_vnodes_to_tablets.py.

The counter table is off by default because counters do not convert to
tablets: a keyspace holding one cannot be migrated in place with
convert_to_tablets_kubectl.bash, it has to be copied into a tablets keyspace
instead.
Without -c, this keyspace migrates as is.

Connects with username/password authentication (defaults: cassandra /
cassandra), so the cluster needs `enableAuth=true` in init.conf.
