Demo: create a small counter table in a vnodes-based keyspace, then copy
it into a new keyspace that has tablets enabled.

Requires ScyllaDB 2026.1 or later — tablets only gained counter support
in that release. On older versions, CREATE TABLE with a counter column
in a tablets-enabled keyspace will be rejected.

On 2026.3+ prefer convert_to_tablets_kubectl.bash, which migrates a counter
table in place (verified: exact values preserved, increments keep working)
and needs no copy. This copy path is for 2026.1/2026.2 clusters, where counters
work on tablets but the in-place migration is not trusted yet — and as a
demo of counter semantics: counters cannot be INSERTed, only incremented,
so the copy is only correct into an empty destination.

Connects with username/password authentication (defaults: cassandra /
cassandra), so the cluster needs `enableAuth=true` in init.conf.

Install driver:  pip install scylla-driver
                  (or: pip install cassandra-driver)
